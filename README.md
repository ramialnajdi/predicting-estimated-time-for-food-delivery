## Introduction
Predicting the delivery time of food is crucial for customer satisfaction and business efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model for food delivery time using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, we can help food delivery services improve their accuracy in delivery estimates and streamline their operations.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [Kaggle Food Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset). It includes features like restaurant location, weather conditions, order time, traffic information, and customer distance.

### Dataset Source:
[Kaggle - Food Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset)

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models
- `datetime`: Handling date and time data
- `statsmodels`: Statistical models

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Acquired the dataset from Kaggle containing food delivery details.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and normalizing data where necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created new features such as delivery distance, traffic severity, and time of day.
4. **Modeling**:
    - Applied various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict delivery time.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Used evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction**: The best-performing model was used to predict delivery times for new data.
7. **Visualization**: Results were visualized through graphs like feature importance plots, residual plots, and comparison of actual vs predicted delivery times.

## Results
The analysis yielded a predictive model with good accuracy in estimating food delivery time. The Random Forest model performed the best, achieving a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and high R-squared score, indicating that it could successfully account for a variety of factors impacting delivery time.

## Usage
To run the model locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-time-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
