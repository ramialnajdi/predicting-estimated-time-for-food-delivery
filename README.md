## Introduction
Predicting the delivery time of food is crucial for customer satisfaction and business efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model for food delivery time using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, we can help food delivery services improve their accuracy in delivery estimates and streamline their operations.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [Kaggle Food Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset). It includes features like restaurant location, weather conditions, order time, traffic information, and customer distance.


## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Acquired the dataset from Kaggle containing food delivery details.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and converting data types.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created new features such as delivery distance, traffic severity, and time of day.
4. **Modeling**:
    - Applied various regression models to predict delivery time.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Used evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction**: The best-performing model was used to predict delivery times for new data.
7. **Visualization**: Results were visualized through graphs like feature importance plots.

## Results
The analysis yielded a predictive model with good accuracy in estimating food delivery time.
